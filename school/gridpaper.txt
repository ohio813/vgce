These instructions are for printing Graphing paper with the same (or better) quality than store-bought paper.
The paper was supposed to represent the Staples 10:1" refill paper that costs a minimum of $3.00+tax(+shipping) CAD for 20 sheets. (I remember it being more expensive than $3.00, but it is listed as such on their website)
The custom paper has near-equal measurements and seemingly higher quality, as well as more grid space.
Now I'm not sure what it costs to refill a HP printer color cartridge but I assume the difference is worth it.

[INSTRUCTIONS]:
  1. Obtain a color printer if you have not already done so.
  2. Insert blank sheets of paper and make sure it is working correctly.
  3. Download and install Irfanview (use google) if you have not already done so.
  4. Open "gridFull.gif" with Irfanview.
  5. Go to Image->Resize/Resample.
  6. Set DPI to 200 (don't touch anything else).
  7. Click OK.
  8. Go to File->Print and select your printer.
  9. Make sure the settings are set as follows:
      Portrait        Paper: Borderless Letter or Letter
      Print size: Original size
      Position: 0,0
      Copies: 1
  10. Click on Print.

If done correctly, between 99% and 100% of the graph should be visible.
If the border of the graph was cut off, try going to Step 6 and use 201 as the DPI setting.
If it is still cut off, then just increase the DPI until it becomes visible.

If the settings are perfect (and you have verified them) you can then print as many sheets as you need or want.

[Additional Info]:
  Grid was made using only MSPaint and Irfanview.
  Sizes:
    Cell:         20x20 pixels (includes borders).
    5x5 Cells:    100x100 pixels (includes borders).
    10x10 Cells:  200x200 pixels (includes borders).
    Full:         1602x2002 pixels.

  Colors:
    Background:         RGB(255, 255, 255) or #FFFFFF AKA white
    Cell border:        RGB(196, 222, 172) or #C4DEAC
    5x5 cell border:    RGB(188, 254, 116) or #BCFE74
    10x10 cell border:  RGB(156, 254, 52)  or #9CFE34

  Creation Steps:
    1. Create a 10x10 grid in MSPaint(See above for information), omitting the right and bottom border.
    2. Open Irfanview and go to "Image->Create Panorama Image...".
    3. Add the grid X number of times horizontally. Save it.
    4. Create a new panorama image and add the previous work X number of times vertically. Save it.
    5. Open it back up in MSPaint and go to "Image->Attributes...". Increase the size by your border size.
    6. Add the border to the right and bottom of your final image.
    7. Save and you're done.
