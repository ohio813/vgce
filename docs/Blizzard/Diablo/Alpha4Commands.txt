=============================================
[Enabling Debug Mode and Other Options]

// Open the executable in a hex editor and modify the following values:
0xBA958     Start in Premade dungeon, Debug Mode Enabled, Random Seed preset to 9, Only enemy is Ice Stalker (blue Skeleton)
0xBA95C     Pre-Release Demo Mode Enabled
0xBA960     Show Intro
0xBA968     Developer Mode Enabled (AFAIK this also makes you unhittable and make 1-hit kills, you can make yourself vulnerable again by going to the menu and turning Cheats: Off)
0xBA970     Show Debug Tiles
0xBA978     Light Radius Mode (Makes darkness so thick you can't even see 1 tile away)

Other notes:
 - Lava and other tiles are messed up
 - Hell just uses the catacomb tiles with no doors, there's also no minimap
 - Several crashes/freezing
 - The caves aren't "closed in". The wall can just be what looks like a cliff.
 - Rarely there will be dungeon generation bugs that prevent you from progressing.
 - Holding the left mouse button will not continue to move your character.
 - There are several items like "Elixers" that can raise and lower individual stats.
 - The stairs leading down from level 16 will bring you to town (the town will be considered level 17, and going to the cathedral 18, etc)
 
Known crashes/freezes:
 - Bad unique item ID; When an item is dropped it can have an ID greater than the number of unique items, causing a buffer overflow. The crash occurs in strcpy/strcat, when referencing a bad pointer for the name of the item. References item ID 89.
   Fix: Set 0xA841C to 0xFF. This hack will remove the unique item "The Celestial Star", but will fix the frequent crashes.
 
 - When loading a level, a freeze occurs when trying to load the file "Monsters\Monsters\rflame.TRN", which doesn't exist.
   Fix: Simply copy and rename another TRN file.
