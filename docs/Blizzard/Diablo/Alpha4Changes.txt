[System]
- Cannot continuously move by holding the mouse button down
- Holding SHIFT to attack in place only works for ranged weapons
- Single player only
- UI is significantly different
- Character/Inventory pages have swapped sides
- Quest Log button is in Character page
- No spell book
- No belt, instead there is a single option that lets you select a potion like a spell
- Many of the sounds used are completely different from the release, most notable are the voices of NPCs and characters

[Town]
- There are no entrances to Catacombs/Cave/Hell
- Wirt is just called "The Peg-legged boy" and only has a random chance of appearing
- The cows can't be selected
- There is no Gossip option
- The only NPCs are: Blacksmith, Tavern Guy, Peg-legged boy, the Witch, the Wounded Townsman, and Cows

[Quest]
- The wounded townsman tells you the Butcher killed his wife and children, and that you should avenge him, which is really cheesy
- The Butcher appears on level 1 instead of level 2
- The Butcher doesn't appear until you talk to the Wounded Townsman

[Objects]
- Barrels seem to have HP of their own

These are only some of the differences. There are many more.
