[size=14][u][b]Region[/b][/u][/size]
A region is a group of tiles(usually under 100 tiles). Regions are used internally for pathfinding, AI, and some other things.

[size=14][u][b]Box-pixel Radius[/b][/u][/size]
Not a true radius. Instead just takes the X +- value, and Y +- value, making it square or boxed like a location with equal dimensions. This greatly increases performance of the application.

[size=18][color=#DFA51C][b]Unit Behaviours[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#EBEE80][b]Air Units[/b][/color] (In General)
[list][*]Always move and patrol to the exact center of a region as depicted in the above screenshot.

[size=18][color=#DFA51C][b]Unit Abilities[/b][/color][/size]
[i]Notes: All abilities follow normal requirement procedures, doesn't target invincible units, etc.
Hero units do not use abilities except for Cloak.
Just because a unit is excluded from a primary target does not mean it isn't included in cluster calculations.[/i]

[list][*]Hits 3 randomizers; one for region, one for X, one for Y. Places a mine within a 256x256 box-pixel radius of an "owned" region's center. The best way to make the AI "own" a region is to run an AI script at the location and place a buildings owned by the computer player in the region.
