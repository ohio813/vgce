Note: Naturally, having enough energy and the technology researched is required.
Additionally, hero units will not follow these rules.

[size=14][b][Common][/b][/size]
The following are general requirements for all spells:
- Target is visible and detected (this includes any revealed areas on the map)
- Target is owned by an enemy player
- Target is not a Protoss Interceptor, Vulture Spider Mine, or Protoss Scarab
- Target is not harvesting gas

[size=14][b][Target Can Attack][/b][/size]
Another common requirement, this time where one of any of the following conditions can be met:
- Target has a ground weapon (with the exception of an unburrowed Lurker)
- Target has an air weapon
- Target is a Protoss Carrier/Gantrithor containing Interceptors
- Target is a Protoss Reaver/Warbringer containing Scarabs
- Target has a subunit with a ground or air weapon.

[size=14][b][Terran Battlecruiser: Yamato Gun][/b][/size]
- [Common] must be true.
- If status flag 0x2 is set and any of [Target Can Attack] is met, then the Battlecruiser will choose this unit.
- If target is a loaded Terran Bunker, then choose this unit.
- Target is not a Zerg Egg
- Target's HP and Shields combined is between 200 and 450
- Target is not a Hero unit
- The target that passed all of these filters will be chosen.

By this logic, the Battlecruiser should also target a larva with the Yamato Gun.
This is true.
The unit is also more likely to choose a target that is within a 512-boxed-pixel radius of the Battlecruiser (X/Y +/- 512).

[size=14][b][Zerg Defiler: Plague][/b][/size]
- [Common] must be true.
- If the target is not currently plagued
- If the target is not a Hero unit
- If all enemy HP combined in a given region is at least 250
- Calculate all ally HP combined in a given region
- If 2 * Ally HP < Enemy HP, the target is chosen. (Basically must do twice as much damage to enemies than to allies)

The unit is more likely to choose a region within a 288-boxed-pixel radius.
If another condition is met, the unit will choose a region within a 4096-boxed-pixel radius.

[size=14][b][Zerg Defiler: Dark Swarm][/b][/size]
- [Common] must be true.
- If the target unit is targetting another unit
- The target's target must be a valid player ( less than 8 ) (Note: in this context, the target is the enemy and the target's target is the AI)
- The target's target must be an enemy of the target
- The target's target must not have a subunit
- The target's target must not be in the air
- The target's target must have a ground weapon
- The target's target weapon behaviour must be "Appear on Attacker" (melee)
- The target(or target's subunit) has a ground weapon
- The target's weapon behaviour must be "Fly & Don't Follow Target", "Fly & Follow Target", "Appear on target unit", "Appear on target site", or "Bounce".
- Additional unknown requirements but that's most of it :P

The unit is more likely to choose a region within a 288-boxed-pixel radius.
Another condition will give it a 1024 or 2048 radius depending on an AI flag.

[size=14][b][Zerg Queen: Parasite][/b][/size]
Note: If a certain AI flag is set, there is a 1 in 32767 chance of the Queen casting this spell every loop.
Otherwise, the Queen will only cast this spell if it has full energy.
- [Common] must be true
- Target must not have parasite detected
- Target has no other particular status ailments, target is an active transport, target is a Spellcaster, target is a worker, or target has a combined HP and Shields value of at least 300

The unit is more likely to cast it on a unit within a 288-boxed-pixel radius.
Another condition will give it a 2048-boxed-pixel radius.


[size=14][b][Terran Medic: Optical Flare][/b][/size]
- [Common] must be true
- Target must not be a building
- Target must not be blind
- Target must be a detector, completed, and must not be disabled, locked down, stasised, maelstromed, or blind
- If the above point is not met, then the unit's current hitpoints and shields combined must be greater than 80
- Unit must have maximum energy stored

The unit is more likely to cast it on a unit within a 288-boxed-pixel radius.
Another condition will give it a 1024-boxed-pixel radius.
