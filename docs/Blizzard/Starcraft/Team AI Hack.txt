Notes: In a 4-force Team game, move to the last force.
       Set the other 3 to Computer.
       Change your force via memory editor to one of the following:

0xFF  yes
0xFE  no
0xFD  yes
0xFC  no
0xFB  yes
0xFA  yes
0xF9  no
0xF8  yes
0x81  no
0x80  no
0x7F  yes
0x7E  no
0x70  yes
0x64  no
0x5A  yes
0x37  no
0x2F  no
0x21  no
0x15  yes
0x09  no; vision of a comp, crapton of resources

Doing so will share your base with a standard Computer AI.
